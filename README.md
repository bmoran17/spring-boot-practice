# Spring Boot 4 Practice

## 01: Spring Boot Overview Projects
- Spring Boot Demo
  - Added a REST controller to handle "/" & return "Hello World"
- Dev Tools Demo
  - Added Spring Boot DevTools & new endpoints to test app automaticaly restarts when modifying code
- Actuator Demo
  - Added Spring Boot Actuator & tested the endpoints /actuator/info,health,beans,mapping,threaddump
- Actuator Security Demo
  - Added Spring Boot Starter Security to secured all actuator endpoints
- Command Line Demo
  - Tested running Spring App from command line 2 ways:
  - Packaging App & running JAR file:`mvn package` & `java -jar` 
  - Spring Boot Maven Plugin:`mvn spring-boot:run`
- Property Demo
  - Defined custom properties in file `application.properties`
  - Set context path to "/mycoolapp"
  - Changed embedded server port to 7070 
  - Injected properties into Spring App 
  - Exposed new endpoint for "/teaminfo" to display properties

## 02: Spring Boot Spring Core Projects
- Constructor Injection
  - Defined dependency interface & class that implements it 
  - Created REST controller
  - Defined constructor for dependency injection
  - Exposed REST endpoint
- Component Scanning
  - Created sub packages inside main Spring Boot app class & moved classes inside
    - Ran app to test component scanning works properly
  - Created sub packages outside main Spring Boot app class
    - had to explicitly configure base packages in `@SpringBootApplication` in order for component scanning to work 
- Setter Injection
  - Deleted constructor for dependency injection
  - Created a setter method annotated with `@Autowired`
- Qualifiers
  - Created multiple implementations of `Coach` interface
  - Used `Qualifier` annotation to specify class name of interface to implement
- Primary
  - Still have multiple implementations of `Coach` interface
  - Added `Primary` annotation to implementation to use
- Lazy Initialization
  - Added `@Lazy` annotation to `TrackCoach` 
    - bean is not injected & created == not initialize 
    - bean created until needed
  - Set up lazy inititalization at a global scale
    - all beans are lazy => no beans created until needed 
- Bean Scope
  - Implemented two dependency injections that: 
    - reference same object instance (singleton bean scope)
    - reference different object instances (prototype bean scope)
- Bean Lifecycle Methods
  - Created a ic
  - Uses annotations: `@PostConstruct` & `@PreDestroy`
- Java Config Bean
  - Created a new implementation of `Coach` without `@Component`
  - Configure bean using Java configuration instead
    - Created new Java class `SportConfig` & annotated it with `@Configuration` to define Spring beans manually
    - Defined @Bean Method to configure bean
    - Injected bean into controller

## 03: Spring Boot Hibernate JPA CRUD Project
- Starter SQl Scripts
  - `create-users.sql` creates new MySQL user for application
  - `student-tracker.sql` creates a new database table: `student`
- CRUD Demo Student
  - Set up Spring Boot project with Hibernate/JPA
    - Set up command line runner to execute code right after Spring Boot starts
    - Added JDBC database connection information
    - Mapped `Student` class to database table
    - Mapped class fields to database columns
   - Set up a data access object to interact with database
